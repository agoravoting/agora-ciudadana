### Introduction

Agora Ciudadana is a social web site where anyone can create or join in an agora.
An agora has a set of members which can vote in the agora's elections either by
direct vote or by delegating the vote.

### Dependencies

* Python 2.x >= 2.7
* python-virtualenv
* python-celery (install with pip system-wide)
* rabbitmq-server
* Has only been tested in Linux so far

Other dependencies can be installed with virtualenv.


### First installation

Here we will detail the most simple way to get the application running. For a
more detailed explanation about how to deploy a django, refer to:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/

First we need to create the virtual environment where dependencies will be
installed:

    $ ./virtualenv.py --system-site-packages env

Now everytime we want to use the installed virtualenv, we can do the
following within the directory containing the env/ subdirectory:

    $ source env/bin/activate

Now we will install the dependencies:

    $ pip install -r dependencies.txt --upgrade

In this step you might get the error "fatal error: Python.h: No such file or
directory". This happens for example in ubuntu. To fix that, you need to install
python2.7-dev package. In Ubuntu/Debian you can do that:

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

After that, we need to configure the database (we use sqlite by default):

    $ ./manage.py syncdb --migrate

If you get an error saying something about xapin not installed, you need to
install the package python-xapian. In ubuntu it comes installed by default,
in openSUSE you can install it by executing "sudo zypper install python-xapian".

We use django haystack for searching, so we need to create the initial index:

    $ ./manage.py rebuild_index

We use celery and rabbitmq for programmed tasks, so you need to setup it correctly
in your server. Usually you just need to install it and run it as a system daemon
with:

    $ sudo /etc/rc.d/rabbitmq start

And then for celery to actually process the tasks sent to it (for example start
or stop an election), you need to run it as a daemon:

    $ ./manage.py celeryd -l INFO -B -S djcelery.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler

That's it! Start the webserver with:

    $ ./manage.py runserver

Now you'll be able to enter to Agora in http://localhost:8000

Of course this is a very simple and local installation. We recomend using a
web server like cherokee, lighthttpd or apache configured to use fast-cgi and
django, and a more powerful database like postgresql. Django documentation
explains how to do that:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/

We also refer to celery documentation for more details on how
to setup them correctly in your server:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/rabbitmq.html

### Translations

Agora Ciudadana has internationalization support and is translated to multiple
languages. In order to make these translations available in your installation,
you need to compile the translation (.po) files:

    $ ./manage.py compilemessages

### Settings configuration

The settings.py file contains the default configuration for the project. You
shouldn't modify it; any settings configuration you need should be added to the
custom_settings.py file.

Most of the variables in settings are self-explanatory and are documented in
django: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/

There are some settings non standard in django in the settings.py file,
quite self explanatory, but you can ask us if you need help with them. See
Contact seccion for that.

For example all the actions are geolocalized based on the user's ip address. But
in order for this to work you need to first have to download the geolocalized
cities data base and put it where the settings.py will look it for:

    $ cd agora_site/media/ && mkdir -p media/data && cd media/data
    $ wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
    $ gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz && rm GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
